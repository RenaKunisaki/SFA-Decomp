# Hack Purge Audit

Owner-directed hyper-aggressive purge of all match hacks (pragmas, gotos,
__declspec section forcing, match-volatiles, pool reconstructions), accepting
match/linkage regressions in exchange for plausible original-shaped source.

## Recovery

The complete pre-purge state is pinned at git tag `pre-hack-purge`
(commit 556a5ac0db). To consult or restore any prior shape:

- Whole tree: `git diff pre-hack-purge` / `git checkout pre-hack-purge -- <file>`
- Per-file hack detail: `git diff pre-hack-purge -- src/main/<file>.c`
- Load-bearing hack inventory with probed per-hack costs: session logs referenced
  in the wave-1/2 cleanup commits (6baee808c1, f4fc2e4464, bb1f92748d).

## Policy going forward

These constructs are BANNED from game code (`src/main/`, `src/track/`) — see the
"Banned constructs" section of CLAUDE.md, which is the enforced source of truth:
no `#pragma` of any kind, no `goto`, no `__declspec(section ...)`, no
match-volatiles/CSE-blocking puns, no dummy `register ... asm("rN")` declarations
used to reserve allocator registers, and no `lbl_`-named pool-reconstruction consts.
Units that cannot match without them stay NonMatching or await a TU re-split.
Residual classes whose only known cure is one of these banned constructs are catalogued,
with measured per-row prices and recognition tells, in `docs/priced_classes.md`.

**The ban is now machine-enforced: `python3 tools/banned_shapes_check.py`.** It scans game code
only (`src/main/`, `src/track/`, `src/dlls/` — the SDK under `src/dolphin/` is exempt by policy and
legitimately carries all seven shapes), reports `file:line`, pattern class and the citation, and
exits nonzero on anything outside `tools/banned_shapes_baseline.txt`. The baseline records the 48
instances standing at the 2026-08-01 audit; **shrink it, never grow it** — a new hit is regrowth and
fails the gate. Two distinctions it draws deliberately, because both were re-litigated per wave
before it existed: a `volatile` write through a hardware address (GX FIFO `0xCC008000`) or a
write-gather pipe is *genuine* and is not flagged, whereas `*(volatile T*)&object` is the banned
pun; and an `lbl_`-named **scalar** const is the pool-reconstruction hack, while an `lbl_`-named
**array** is real data with an unrecovered name (reported only under `--strict-lbl`, never gating).
Run `--self-test` before trusting any census from it: it validates in both directions, firing on the
historical corpus at the `pre-hack-purge` tag and staying silent on the exempt and hardware cases.

### Compliance state at 2026-08-02 (the audit that motivated the checker)

**All 50 instances are post-purge RE-ENTRIES** — none survived the original purge. They arrived over
roughly 20 commits across 12 days, from multiple authors. The root cause was not carelessness at the
keyboard: a **stale w56 memory entry** advertised the pool-anchor shape as an accepted technique long
after the ban, so lanes were reintroducing it *by the book*. That entry is being retracted. The
lesson generalizes past this case: **a ban enforced only by prose in a memory file decays at the rate
its stalest copy is read.** This checker exists so the ban is enforced by the build instead.

Re-purging is **not** free and is **not** the lane's call: measured over 11 instances the removal
cost **−2156 B and −3 matched functions**, and the gate failed even restricted to the NonMatching
set. So the 50 stand as an explicit, recorded baseline pending **maintainer adjudication** of that
trade; the checker's baseline mode holds the line at the current count meanwhile — nothing new may
enter, and each cure shrinks the file. Two `lbl_`-named instances are **mandatory-fix-pending**
regardless of the score trade, since a `lbl_`-named definition is the shape the ban names outright.

**Two independent scans of the same tree disagreed by one, in both directions.** The audit found 49,
this checker found 48, and the union is **50** — each had exactly one instance the other lacked. The
audit's extra was `Transporter.c:228 const f32 gWarpPadRestZero[1] = {0.0f};`, never read anywhere in
the tree, which a reads-keyed check cannot see; the checker's extra was
`engine/9/9.c:45 volatile f32 gCloudActionGlareQuadSize[2]`, the declaration form of the
match-volatile. Both are now covered and both are pinned by self-tests. The methodological point is
worth more than the count: **two scans agreeing on a total is not agreement on a set** — reconcile
membership, not cardinality.

### Purge price sheet -- 16 files / 29 instances, measured 2026-08-02 @cd782d6179

Method per row: plain-literal or structured replacement, DEMOTE to NonMatching where the unit was
MatchingFor, full `ninja`, tree-wide metrics vs baseline, `cmp` against `orig/GSAE01/sys/main.dol`,
per-function regression scan, revert. Baseline: code 87.212080 / data 99.015740 / 9285 fns /
fuzzy 99.815330, DOL identical.

⚠️ **"Control first" — THIS CONTROL WAS ITSELF DEAD.** I ran demotion ALONE (flip, no purge), read
**+0.000000 on every metric with DOL SAME**, and concluded each row priced the purge and not the
flip. But that control was measured through the same never-rebuilt `report.json` as the rows it was
validating. **A control routed through the broken path returns "no change" for ANY input**, so it is
indistinguishable from a control that passes — it certified the dead instrument instead of catching
it. A control only has power when it is independent of the mechanism under test. The flip's true
contribution is therefore still unmeasured.

⚠️ **THE `+0.000000` COLUMNS BELOW WERE A DEAD SENSOR — corrected 2026-08-02.** My harness ran a
bare `ninja`, which builds `default build/GSAE01/main.dol` and **not** `report.json` (a separate
target — CLAUDE.md's two-command rebuild recipe is load-bearing, not ceremony). So every score delta
was computed against a frozen baseline and returned `+0.000000` by construction, and the
demotion-only "control" was measured through the same frozen file, so it certified the dead
instrument instead of catching it. The DOL column was a real `cmp` against the reference and is the
one figure below that was never affected. The adjudicated standing price is
**`docs/priced_classes.md` §6**; the trades were reviewed and KEPT.

Tree-wide banked total: **fuzzy −0.0011, data −992 B, five functions off 100.**

**How to read the ten "bounded" rows — they are stronger than "pending".** §6's measurement was
**window-level**: a full rebuild at both endpoints of `cd782d6179 -> 5b120c0545`. That window
contains **exactly the two purge commits and nothing else**, and touches **exactly these 15 units and
no others** (verified with `git log`/`git diff --name-only` over the range). So its five-row list is
**complete for functions**: any function in any of these units that fell off 100 would necessarily
have appeared in it. The ten rows therefore carry a real bound — **no function-level regression is
attributable to them** — and what remains unmeasured is only the exact per-row **data/pool**
attribution of the −992 B, which the window total does not decompose.
That is a genuine bound, not a confirmation of "free": the −992 B is real and some of it belongs to
these rows. Do not promote "bounded" to "free" without a per-row data measurement.

Landed as `21b90aff9f` (22 instances / 13 units) and `5b120c0545` (2 gotos). ~~All 24 measured
instances were free.~~ **RETRACTED** — that claim rests entirely on the dead sensor described above.
The purges stand (reviewed and KEPT), but they were **not** free: the banked price is five functions
off 100, tree fuzzy −0.0011 and data −992 B. Both commit messages also assert
`dfuzzy +0.000000 / 0 per-function regressions`; those sentences are wrong for the same reason and
`docs/priced_classes.md` §6 supersedes them.

**CONFIRMED CROSS-LANE.** A second lane, working its own six files independently, purged
`src/main/rcp_dolphin.c`'s one-element anchors (`gRcpDistortScaleA`, `gRcpDistortPowExp`,
`gRcpDistortColorScale` -> plain literals) and had to flip the unit `Matching -> NonMatching` in the
same change. Same mechanism, different lane, different files, no shared instrument: purging a pool
anchor from a matched unit changes its object and therefore forces demotion. That is the strongest
form of confirmation available here, because the two measurements share no tooling — and it is
notably NOT the sensor that failed, since demotion was forced by the object, not by a score.

**Demotion is load-bearing, and that finding SURVIVES the sensor failure — because it never rested on
the score.** Purging *without* demoting builds clean yet **breaks DOL byte-identity**, measured by
`cmp` against `orig/GSAE01/sys/main.dol` — the one gate not routed through `report.json`. (The
original wording added "and leaves every score delta at zero"; that half was the dead sensor and is
withdrawn. The DOL half is real, and it is what forced the demotions.) This is the purge gate's final form earning its keep: `matched_data`
cannot separate "pairing artifact" from "bytes differ", and only the DOL distinguishes them. Since a
purged object is no longer byte-identical to retail, `NonMatching` is its honest state per CLAUDE.md,
and demoting lets the retail object link so the DOL holds. Corollary for reading the table: on a
demoted row **`DOL SAME` is vacuous** (the retail object links by construction) -- the informative
columns are the score deltas, which is why the demotion-only control is mandatory.

**track_dolphin is not a mechanical purge.** Its 5 gotos exit from nesting **depth 7-8 to depth 4**
(`goto hitCheck` x4) and **depth 6 to depth 2** (`goto slotComplete`) inside
`trackGetIntersect2`. Structuring them needs flag variables threaded through three to four enclosing
loops -- a rewrite whose codegen impact would swamp the gotos themselves, so any "price" measured
from a mechanical transform would be measuring the rewrite, not the purge. The unit is already
NonMatching (48.241% code), so it carries no DOL exposure and no demotion is required; it needs a
dedicated derivation round, not a purge pass.

**Semantic safety was verified before application, not inferred from the score.** engine/9's
`gCloudActionGlareQuadSize` has no ISR/DVD/ARQ/alarm path (the callbacks in that unit are the
ordinary resource-descriptor table); 203's `gDllCBDefaultAnimSpeed` is a same-TU `const f32 = 0.1f`
whose pun reads a compile-time constant; MMP_moonroc's `spacingClear` is written on every path
reaching its read (0 via the goto, 1 via fallthrough), which is what makes seed-and-break exact.

### Policy question the evidence creates: track_dolphin's 5 gotos are PROVEN FAITHFUL

The checker's baseline still carries `src/main/track_dolphin.c` lines 2298 / 2359 / 2426 / 2478 / 2516
as GOTO instances. Evidence now says four of the five reproduce retail's own control flow exactly, so
**this is a policy question, not a cleanup backlog**. The evidence is ours; the decision is the
maintainer's. Both options are legitimate:

**Option A - admit a proven-faithful exception class.** CLAUDE.md's goto ban gains a narrow carve-out
for instances demonstrated to reproduce retail's structure, annotated in the baseline with their
proof. Argument for: the ban exists to stop match-hacks, and a construct that *is* the original source
is the opposite of a hack; keeping it is what "recover the plausible 2002 C" means. Argument against:
every exception class costs enforcement clarity, and "proven faithful" is a judgement a future lane
must re-derive to trust.

**Option B - keep them as permanent baseline entries.** The ban stays absolute; these five stay listed,
never fixed, in a unit that is already NonMatching. Argument for: the rule stays mechanical and the
checker stays a bright line. Argument against: a permanent never-to-be-fixed baseline entry trains
readers to ignore the baseline, which is the failure mode the checker was built to end.

**The evidence, stated at its real strength.** `trackGetIntersect2` (retail `.text:0x3a8c`, 1115 insns)
emits four sites of the identical shape `cmpwi rX,0 ; beq- <skip> ; li r19,1 ; b 0x482c`, converging on
a join that opens `extsh r0,r19 ; cmpwi r0,0 ; beq-`. That maps statement-for-statement onto the four
`goto hitCheck` and the `hitCheck: if (hit != 0)` label. Corroboration: `r19` is touched by **only**
`li` and `extsh` in the whole function (a pure flag, never arithmetic), and the `extsh` proves a
halfword — the source's `s16 hit;` already agrees.

⚠️ **Two honest limits.** (1) The 5th goto, `goto slotComplete` (2516), is a **single** far jump;
single-source branches are equally consistent with a `break`, so it is carried by the same-function
shape, **not independently proven**. (2) The convergence census that located this is a **heuristic,
not a test** — goto-free functions show convergence too, and the `return N;`-to-epilogue family is a
standing false positive. The verdict rests on the statement-level mapping, not on the census.

**Not affected:** the two gotos purged in `5b120c0545` were retro-checked under the same method and
show **no** flag-pattern convergence, so those rewrites did not move their units away from retail.

**The lawful counterpart, for contrast — `5fe6d7d9f9` ("202: recover the file-scope constants three
units declare").** The dual-emission rule (named consts emit at their DEFINITION position, literals
at FIRST USE) is what makes a differing pool order reachable *only* through the banned named-constant
shape. That is a prohibition on **fabricating** an anchor, not on **recovering** one: where a unit
genuinely declares a file-scope constant, writing it out is the rule's lawful application and the
pool follows for the right reason. `5fe6d7d9f9` is the mechanism's first upstream use in that
direction (`hagabon_mk2.c`, `mikaladon.c`, `vambat.c`, +`mikaladon.h`).
**The distinction the maintainer is actually being asked to rule on is the same one:** a construct
that reproduces what the original source did is recovery; a construct introduced because it moves a
score is a hack. track_dolphin's gotos are argued to be the former — on evidence, not on preference.

### ⚠️ Baseline keying is line-number based, and that is brittle
`tools/banned_shapes_baseline.txt` keys `file:line:class`, so **any edit above an instance reports it
as one fix plus one regrowth**. Observed live: a peer commit shifted MMP_moonroc's goto 427 -> 426 and
the checker read "1 fixed, 1 regrowth" for an untouched instance. Read a fix/regrowth pair in the same
file and class as a line shift until proven otherwise; a future revision should key on symbol or
snippet instead.

### Provenance, when auditing a rehoming tree

`git log -S` dates when a line **moved**, not when it was **written**. In a tree that rehomes sources
between directories, that difference is the whole answer, and `-S` will confidently misattribute an
old hack to the recent commit that relocated its file. **`git grep <pattern> <sha>` at a reference
sha is the only reliable provenance test here** — ask whether the shape existed at that sha, rather
than asking git to narrate its history.

## Waves 1-2 (complete purge of src/main + src/track)

Overall fuzzy 99.841156 -> 90.559875.
Roughly 3,200 hack lines removed in total (all pragmas, all gotos, all __declspec
section forcing, match-volatiles, pool reconstructions). Everything compiles; DOL
byte-identical via demotions (retail objs link in place of changed units). Hardware
volatiles (GX FIFO, VI/PE interrupt state) retained. Per-lane hack detail lives in the
purge commits and the incremental per-file audit fragments referenced there.
