"""Compare a unit's built CONSTANT-POOL CONTENT against the retail image.

The missing third leg beside order_check (function placement) and
section_size_check (section extents). Both of those, plus objdiff's fuzzy score,
are structurally blind to a pool whose SIZE is right and whose VALUES are wrong:

  * objdiff pairs .text functions by name and scores instruction content. An
    `lfs f1, -0x49f4(r2)` scores identical to the retail `lfs f1, -0x49e8(r2)`
    under mnemonic comparison of a matched function only if the displacement
    also matches -- but when the WRONG VALUE lands at the RIGHT SLOT the .text
    is byte-identical and the defect is entirely in .sdata2, which fuzzy never
    reads.
  * section_size_check compares sizes only. A same-size, wrong-content pool
    passes it.
  * main.dol's sha1 is blind while the unit is INCOMPLETE, because the link
    consumes the retail object. The defect appears the instant it is promoted.

A wrong VALUE is rarer than it looks, so the verdicts are graded. Only
VALUE-DIFF -- a word present in ours that retail does not hold anywhere in the
unit's pool -- can be a miscoded literal. PERM (same multiset, other order) and
PAD (differs only in zero/0x80000000 alignment words) are emission-order
artifacts; SUBSET means the unit is merely incomplete. cameramodeforcebehind,
long cited as a wrong-value case, is in fact a PERM.

Four things this must get right, because each one on its own manufactures a
census of phantom defects, and a phantom pool defect is the documented bait for
the banned pool-reconstruction hack.

  * A unit may claim `.sdata2` MORE THAN ONCE -- keeping only the last claim
    compares a whole pool against a fragment of itself.
  * A SHIFT (pool matching verbatim at another address, meaning the claim is
    misplaced) is only evidence when the untruncated pool is long enough to be
    unique: an 8-byte prefix recurs hundreds of times in a float pool.
  * The MULTISET must be built from our WHOLE pool. When ours is longer than
    the claim the positional walk is truncated to the claim, and reusing that
    truncated prefix for the multiset compares a fragment of ourselves against
    all of retail -- SUPERSET becomes unreachable and every under-claimed unit
    reads as a wrong-value BAD. objhits, track/intersect, engine/86,
    SB_Galleon and synth_seq_dispatch were all BAD for this reason alone.
  * Weak (COMDAT) words are not pool content. MSL's inlined sqrt/sqrtf carry
    `_half`/`_three` f64 local statics as weak symbols that the linker keeps
    ONE copy of image-wide, so they are in no unit's split range.

UNDERCLAIM is the graded verdict for a superset the retail object itself
explains: when retail's own code reaches BELOW its claimed start, the claim is
the TAIL of the real pool and the surplus is a split-boundary artifact. A
residual BAD is also annotated with any function we define that retail does
not, since an extra function mints its own constants.

Ground truth is orig/GSAE01/sys/main.dol. For each unit that claims a data
range in config/GSAE01/splits.txt, this reads the same-named section out of our
built object and compares it word-for-word against the retail bytes at the
claimed address.

_SDA2_BASE_ = 0x803E6500, _SDA_BASE_ = 0x803E31E0 (displacements are printed
relative to whichever base covers the address, to line up with the .text).
