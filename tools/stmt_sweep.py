"""Brute-force a function's register allocation by permuting the ORDER OF ITS
ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS (first-definition order), rebuilding + measuring each
variant against true objdiff fuzzy%.

WHY THIS EXISTS -- the lever tools/brute_match.py cannot reach
-------------------------------------------------------------
Declaration order keys REGISTER ASSIGNMENT; the order of the assignment
statements keys EMISSION ORDER.  They are different axes and a function can be
inert on one and not the other, so a declaration sweep coming back flat says
nothing about how the same statements would score written in another sequence.
That second axis is what this tool permutes.

(An earlier rationale here claimed the saved-GPR band was filled in two phases,
with a "phase 1" ordered by reverse first-definition order for webs that never
reach a loop header.  That model has been REFUTED by measurement and must not
be reinstated: the saved band is contiguous and monotone downward, and the FPR
band has no separate law.  The tool's own axis stands on its own.)

WHAT IT PERMUTES
----------------
Maximal runs of ADJACENT simple assignment statements at one scope level, in
every scope of the function (body, loop bodies, if/else arms, case blocks).
A statement joins a run only when it is provably reorderable:

  * form is exactly `name = expr;` or `name <op>= expr;`
  * `name` is a local declared in this function (or a parameter)
  * `name` never has its address taken anywhere in the function
  * `expr` contains NO call, NO `++`/`--`, NO nested assignment, no top-level
    comma

Everything else -- a call, a store through a pointer (`p->f = x`, `a[i] = x`,
`*p = x`), a declaration, any control flow -- is a BARRIER and terminates the
run.  Because the only memory WRITES in a run are to non-address-taken locals,
memory reads inside the run commute freely, so the only orderings that must be
preserved are the RAW / WAR / WAW edges over those local names.  Every emitted
permutation is checked against that dependence relation, so a rewrite is always
semantics-preserving.

Runs are swept one at a time by coordinate ascent -- each run is permuted with
the others pinned at the best ordering found so far.

Usage:
  python3 tools/stmt_sweep.py <unit> <symbol> [-v GSAE01]
      [--list-runs] [--run N] [--max-variants N] [--time-budget SECONDS]
      [--strategy swaps|moves|all] [--min-items N] [--dry-run]

Notes:
  * SJIS-safe: the file is read/written as latin-1 (byte-transparent).
  * Each statement keeps its exact source text (multi-line expressions move as
    one unit).
  * Crash-safe: a `<file>.stmtbak` sidecar holds the pristine bytes for the
    whole run; a hard kill is repaired on the next invocation.
  * SHARED-TREE safe: the final restore only fires when the on-disk bytes are
    still the ones THIS process last wrote.  A concurrent peer edit inside the
    sweep window aborts the restore loudly and leaves the sidecar in place
    rather than silently reverting the peer's work.

# `collect_runs` decides which statements may join a run AND derives the
# dependence relation that keeps their reorderings legal -- one function, one
# model, checking itself.  If `classify` under-reports a statement's uses, the
# missing RAW edge is missing from `deps` too, `valid()` agrees, and an illegal
# ordering is emitted with nothing to catch it: no build gate in this project
# compares retail's MEANING, so it would land as a win.
#
# So the control below re-derives the relation a SECOND time, from the
# statement TEXT, with no use of `classify`, `top_level_assign` or `IDENT`'s
# call sites -- and every ordering the tool would emit must be legal under
# BOTH.  `--self-test --mutate` corrupts `classify` on purpose and requires the
# independent relation to catch the illegal ordering that results; a control
# that has never been shown to fail is not a control.
