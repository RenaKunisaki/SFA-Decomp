"""Compare two build endpoints on EVERY axis a match can be lost on, with a
positive control that runs first.

Why this exists
---------------
Commits 21b90aff9f and 5b120c0545 each recorded "dfuzzy +0.000000 / ddata
+0.000000 / 0 per-function regressions". Full rebuilds plus report.json at
those two shas measure tree 99.81533 -> 99.81422, matched_data 1198129 ->
1197137 (-992 across 11 DLL units), complete_units 877 -> 862, and five
functions knocked off 100.0. The purge itself was policy-correct; the
MEASUREMENT was wrong, and nothing downstream caught it:

  * the units were DEMOTED, so the forced-link / DOL gate stayed green -- a
    NonMatching unit is allowed to differ, so the DOL is rebuilt from the
    retail object and the loss is invisible there;
  * matched_code alone does not move when a pool shrinks, so a matched_code
    gate reads zero;
  * and a loader that reaches for the wrong JSON path scores every function
    -1 on BOTH sides, so its regression list is empty by construction.

There is a fourth way to lose ground with every score axis flat, and no score
can see it. matched_data is all-or-nothing per section, so a data section that
is already short of 100 can be rotated arbitrarily far from its retail carve
for free: ddata +0, dfuzzy +0.000000, no regression, no demotion, not one
instruction changed. That is what 5d467157cb, f5fe00213f and 620b69dc2d each
did (-144, -60, -16 bytes). The answer is not another score: it is to compare
the bytes. The POOL WORD-DIFF below reads our built objects and the retail
carve straight out of the ELF and diffs their data sections word for word.

That last one is not hypothetical. objdiff's report puts a function's score at
`function["fuzzy_match_percent"]`; a loader written against
`function["measures"]["fuzzy_match_percent"]` gets an empty dict for every
function, defaults them all to the same sentinel, and prints "REGRESSED 0" for
any input whatsoever. A harness that cannot fail is indistinguishable from a
harness that passed.

So this tool refuses to report a zero it has not earned. Every mode runs the
schema guard, and the build modes run an end-to-end positive control -- a
synthetic regression injected into real source, rebuilt through the real
pipeline, which the differ must catch -- before the real comparison is
allowed to print a verdict.

What it compares
----------------
  per function   fuzzy_match_percent: REGRESSED / IMPROVED / LOST / NEW, plus
                 UNSCORED (objdiff OMITS the key at 0.0, so a 0% function
                 looks like a missing one) and NEW-UNSCORED. LOST and NEW are
                 paired by virtual address + size so a two-sided rename does
                 not read as a loss.
  per unit       matched_data -- the axis the purge regressions actually moved.
  per unit       metadata.complete -- a DEMOTION is reported even when it costs
                 nothing, because demotion is what blinds the DOL gate.
  per section    fuzzy_match_percent, so a pool that scores 0/84 is visible.
  per section    the POOL WORD-DIFF: our built object's data sections compared
                 word for word against the retail carve, positionally and as a
                 multiset. This is the only layer here that is not derived from
                 a score, and it is the only one that sees a pool ROTATION
                 inside an already-NonMatching unit -- matched_data is
                 all-or-nothing per section, so a section already short of 100
                 can be rotated further from its carve at ddata +0, dfuzzy
                 +0.000000, zero regressions and zero demotions. 5d467157cb,
                 f5fe00213f and 620b69dc2d each did exactly that.
  tree           the top-level measures block.
  the DOL        endpoint B is force-linked (main.dol and main.elf deleted
                 first, or ninja no-ops) and its md5 compared to retail, because
                 a MatchingFor DLL unit's pool links into main.dol .sdata2 and a
                 purge there can grow the DOL while all_source stays green.

Usage
-----
  python3 tools/score_delta_gate.py --self-test
  python3 tools/score_delta_gate.py --commits <A> <B>
  python3 tools/score_delta_gate.py --head
  python3 tools/score_delta_gate.py --reports A.json B.json
  python3 tools/score_delta_gate.py --reports A.json B.json --no-positive-control

--commits and --head build BOTH endpoints from scratch in throwaway worktrees
(git worktree add --detach; nothing is ever checked out in your tree) and run
the build-layer positive control. --reports diffs two report.json files you
already have; it still runs the schema guard and the differ-layer control, and
it warns that the build layer went unproven.

Exit status: 0 clean, 1 regressions found, 2 usage/build error, 3 the positive
control failed -- meaning the tool could not prove it can see a loss, so its
verdict is worthless and must not be quoted.
